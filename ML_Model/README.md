# Code related to the machine learning model for CoVerifi.

The file CoAID_using_HashingTrick.h5 is the model used in our paper. Our app.py file in the Python_Backend folder on our GitHub has been updated to reflect our usage of this model. The file BiLSTM_Trained_on_CoAID.ipynb provides the code used to train and save our model. The file BiLSTM_External_Validation.ipynb provides a sample of using our model (once saved) to produce the external validation results discussed in the paper.
